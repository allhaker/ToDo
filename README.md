# ToDo - Local Ajax jQuery Requests

This is a small README desicribing what ToDo repository is all about.

## About ToDo

ToDo is small Front-End app running `jQuery`. It is using `AJAX` on local `JSON` files. It does **NOT** contain any Back-End. And, therfore, it is pretty much static.

App is very minimalistic. It allows user to to see ToDo notes, deleted them and add new. When new is added - the dummy one is loaded from JSON, same with delete - after page reload everything is in the intitial state. I think you've already gussed that these JSON files could replace to an `API` and app would be fully functionnal.

I usually don't write somewhat complex apps with `jQuery` and use `AngularJS` instead. So, I tried to implement more or less reasonable application structure here which you can checkout at `app.js` file.
